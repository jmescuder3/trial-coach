    <h1>Cross-Examniation</h1>
  
  <!-- Needs to be paragraphed and generally marked up -->  	

<em>In the Anglo American legal system, cross examination is the principal means of undermining the credibility of a witness whose testimony is false or inaccurate.</em>
<em>-- John Paul Stevens (Dissenting in U.S. v Salerno, 505 U.S. 317)</em>

If there is one skill at which the trial lawyer must excel, it’s cross examination. A trial lawyer who can’t cross has no bite. A trial lawyer with no bite has no chance.

Though it must be mastered, don’t panic; cross-examination is not challenging if you keep in mind a few general principles. While, as is always true, there are circumstances when you might want to deviate or be less strict with these rules, on the whole, following the course outlined below will make you a formidable opponent as you duel with the witness.

<hr />

<h1>Do No Harm (To your own case. It's okay to harm your opponent's case.)</h1>
Don’t feel like you must cross examine every witness. Keep in mind that, as with objections, cross examining a witness elevates the importance of that witness. Thus, before engaging in cross examination, ask yourself whether the witness’ direct examination testimony hurt you. If not, don’t cross examine that witness. Standing up and saying “no questions” sends a clear message to the jury that you’re not bothered by anything that witness said.

In some circumstances, even consider not cross examining a witness whose testimony <em>does</em> hurt you - if you don’t have any reasonable expectation of scoring points with that witness.

Let’s say, for example, that the prosecution has DNA evidence against your client. Before trial, you submitted the prosecution’s evidence to your own expert, and she reported back that their evidence is solid. Now, the trial has arrived, and the prosecution has placed your client’s DNA on the victim.

Clearly, this evidence hurts you. But, if you’ve developed a theory that accounts for this evidence, you may not need to cross examine. Perhaps your defense is that the DNA didn’t get there in the manner that the prosecution claims that it did, or that it got there at a different time. Saying “no questions” downplays the importance of this evidence. It also gets that witness off the stand. There simply is no benefit to crossing a witness, even a witness who has delivered harmful evidence, if you can’t challenge them with anything. Instead, ask no questions and send the message that you know about this testimony, and you accept it as consistent with your theory of innocence.

[Needless to say, if you don’t question the DNA expert, your defense cannot be that the expert’s testimony is wrong. In other words, you must cross witnesses whose testimony contradicts your theory.]

<hr />

<h1>Ask No Questions</h1>
You can lead on cross examination. Do so. <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/0684863065" target="_blank">As Roy Black said</a>: “Think of cross-examination as a series of statements by the lawyer, only occasionally interrupted by a yes from the witness.”

What does it mean to “lead?” A leading question is that which contains the information that you want the witness to affirm. So, instead of asking “where did you go after the party?,” state, “you went to Jeanine’s after the party.”

Two things to note about this. First, a minority of judges will not let you ask questions in purely statement form, as demonstrated above. No problem. Simply add an interrogatory at the end of the statement, like this: “You went to Jeanine’s after the party, didn’t you?” Ask a few questions in this manner and then try to revert back to the statement form, without the “didn’t you?,” “isn’t that right?,” that you tack on to the end. By then, most judges will realize that insisting that your questions contain an interrogative is a tedious restriction.

The second thing about leading questions - and I know that this is anathema to most trial attorneys - is that I believe that it is acceptable to ask non-leading questions on cross examination under certain circumstances, for effect.

Generally, you do not want to ask open questions because such questions surrender your power to the witness, and allow them to explain themselves. You don’t want that. Really, <em>you</em> are the witness on cross examination. As Roy Black says, the witness is really there to affirm what you are saying.

But, when you absolutely know what the witness will say, or when it doesn’t matter, asking an open-ended question can be a powerfully persuasive moment. This is because, even though it’s good technique, jurors innately know that a witness who is only given the chance to answer leading questions isn’t really being given a chance to fully explain themselves. For this reason, I believe that jurors tend to credit evidence elicited on direct examination more than what is obtained on cross.

But, if you can safely set up a moment of openness within your cross examination, you have the opportunity to create a moment in the trial that the jurors will remember into their deliberations. Here’s an example:

I recently had a conspiracy trial in which the prosecution claimed that my client was at the center of a drug distribution ring. The problem for the prosecution though, was that my client never appeared at any of the drug deals, nor was his name mentioned in any phone call. Thus, after a direct examination in which a police officer testified as to everything he saw happen at a drug deal outside of a McDonald’s, I was able to ask: “Officer, at what time did Lawrence arrive at the McDonald’s?” This was not a leading question, but it was safe one because I knew the answer: Lawrence never arrived there.

[But what, you may ask, should you do, if the officer says something that appears in no report, like he arrived at 10:00? This is not a problem, you simply have to impeach by omission. I would also note that this possibility is not avoided by asking a leading question since, if you say,”Lawrence never arrived at that location, did he?”, the officer can simply say, “Yes he did. He arrived at 10:00”]

<h1>Add Only One Fact Per Question</h1>
You only cross examine hostile witnesses, meaning that, on cross examination, you’re trying to get people to say things that they don’t want to say, or admit things that they don’t want to admit. You’re going to have more success at doing this by keeping them off-balance, and the best way to do that is to keep hitting them, rapid-fire, with questions. Therefore, use short questions, get your “Yes,” and then hit them with another question.

For an example of what this looks like, see the sample cross below.

Another benefit of just adding one fact per question is that it prevents the witnesses from pretending they don’t understand the question, or from trying to answer something that was not exactly what was asked.

Finally, and this relates to keeping the witness off-balance, the longer your question, the more time you give the witness to compose their response. If you keep things at a fast pace, the witness will have less time to try and outsmart you. Just be sure you don’t go so fast that the jury can’t understand what you’re asking.

<hr />

<h1>Organize Your Cross Into Chapters</h1>
Your cross examination must be organized. The best way to do this is to organize your examination into “chapters,” a technique put forth by <a href="http://www.pozneranddodd.com/index.html" target="_blank">Pozner and Dodd</a>, whose “Killer Cross” seminar I recommend. [Note that organizing your questions into chapters works for <a title="Direct Examination" href="http://www.jaimeescuder.com/direct-examination/" target="_blank">direct examination</a> as well.]

The idea behind chapters is that, for any witness, there are probably several different topics that you want to cover. For a police officer, for example, you may want to cross examine on the circumstances behind your client’s arrest, as well as his interrogation. Each of these can be further subdivided. You may want to set the scene for the arrest, before establishing who was present for it etc. Dividing your overall examination into these smaller segments keeps you from forgetting to cross examine on key points, while at the same time presenting the testimony in a logical manner for the jury. It also allows you to exploit the principles of primacy and recency, which state that the things that jurors remember the most are what is presented to them first and last.

By approaching your cross as a number of mini-examinations, instead of as one large one, you have lots of opportunities to introduce new topics, signalling to the jury that their attention should rekindled.

What does a chapter look like?

The first and most important rule is to make sure that each chapter fits on one page. If you have more questions than what will fit on a page, divide your questions into two chapters.

My chapter pages typically look like this:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Officer Smith: James Was in Custody</span>

The door was locked
43 B

The room had no windows.
42 T

Etc. [End of Chapter 1]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-mark="1">Officer Smith: The Confession Was Involuntary</span>

James told you he was hungry
58 M

James hadn’t slept in three days.
62 B

Etc. [End of Chapter 2]

Note that, at the top of the page, in bold, I put the name of the Witness and the point that I’m trying to make with that chapter.
Beneath that, I have specific questions, followed by the pages in the discovery that has the information that I'm trying to establish, should I need to impeach with a prior inconsistent statement. I use T, M, and B to indicate whether the specific information is at the top, middle, or bottom of that page. I also highlight the specific sentence I’m referring to, so that I can easily find it.

Organizing your cross examination is the most important tip that I can give you. Structuring not only your cross, but your entire approach to the trial, will give your arguments a force that simply cannot be obtained from a defense that is unplanned and unfocused. The purpose of cross examination is to get out those key points that you need to have in order to make your dream closing argument. By strategizing your cross and dividing it into chapters, you ensure that, when you sit down after your examination, you have the ammunition you need to close persuasively.

<h1>Impeach With Style</h1>
Impeachment is the process by which you discredit the credibility of a witness. Not only is it one of the most effective things that you can do on cross examination, it can be one of the most dramatic moments in a trial. Do it wrong, however, and you can come across as inept. Even worse, the witness could beat you at your own game by making it look like you are the one with the wrong information. So, impeachment is too important to avoided, but it is also too potent to be handled without confidence.

The two most common methods of impeachment are impeachment with a prior inconsistent statement and impeachment by omission. Master both. Once you do, you'll see that, in the trial arena, nothing gets your blood pumping like impeachment. Get comfortable with it, and you will soon look forward to the little embellishments that some witnesses just can’t keep from making during their testimony.

<strong>Impeachment by Prior Inconsistent Statement</strong>

This type of impeachment arises when one of the witnesses testifies to something that is different from what appears in your discovery.

In the criminal defense setting, this typically happens when someone testifies to something that is different from what they told the police. In this circumstance, you must give the witness an opportunity to admit making the statement. If they persist in their denial, you must perfect the impeachment by calling the witness to whom the statement was made.

Let’s take a closer look.

Let’s say that, on direct examination, witness Jones testified that he saw your client pull the trigger. On the day of the shooting, however, he told the police that he was too far away to make an identification.

First, you must give the witness the opportunity to admit that he made the statement. If you don’t, your impeachment is improper. Second, start with the fact that you’re trying to elicit, then move on to the statement. Like this:

Q. Mr. Jones, you don’t know who shot Rodney?

A. Yes I do. It was your client.

Q. You were standing too far away?

A. No. I could see just fine.

Q. That’s not what you told Officer Baker.

A. Yes it is. I told him I saw everything.

Okay, that’s it for this witness (on this issue). The impeachment has been set up. Now you perfect it by calling officer Baker.

[Two things before going further.

One, if the witness admits making the statement to officer Baker (if, for example, he says, yeah I told him that, but that’s only because I was afraid, you’re done. The witness has been impeached. You cannot call Officer Baker for the purpose of eliciting this statement, since you’ve already obtained it.

Two, you cannot ask Jones about a statement to Baker unless you have a good-faith basis to believe that the statement was actually made. In other words, you cannot make up a pretend statement for the purpose of misleading the jury. You must be able to prove up the impeachment. Failing to do so would be unethical.]

Perfect the Impeachment by Calling Officer Baker

Q. Officer, did you meet with Jones on the day of the shooting? [Note that you can’t lead since, presumably, you’re calling Baker in your case-in-chief and she is, therefore, technically a friendly witness.]

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you ask her whether she saw anything?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did she tell you?

A. She told me that she could not see anything, because she was too far away.

Done. Jones has been impeached. Note that this is a very quick impeachment. You can draw it out a little for effect, if you want. For example, you could highlight the officer’s credentials or meticulous note-taking before asking about the conversation with Jones.

So, that’s a general overview of how you impeach with a prior inconsistent statement. Keep in mind that the prior statement need not necessarily have been oral. You can impeach with a writing, a picture, a videotape, whatever. All that is required is that the information that you have in your possession somehow contradicts the witness’ trial testimony.

<strong>Impeachment by Omission</strong>

The opportunity to impeach by omission arises when a witness testifies to something at trial for the first time. In the context of a criminal trial, this usually means that a police officer has attributed a statement to your client that appears in none of the police reports.

[Needless to say, in order to impeach in this way, you must be certain that the statement does not, in fact, appear anywhere. In other words, you must know the facts of your case cold. There is nothing more mortifying than asking a witness to show you where the statement is - and then having them show it to you.

The key to successful impeachment by omission is remembering this acronym: <b>ARC</b>.

ACCREDIT the document that should contain the statement.

RECOMMIT the witness to the statement, and then

CONFRONT the witness with the fact that the statement is absent from the document.

Here we go. [As with impeachment by prior inconsistent statement, start by asking the witness about the ultimate fact that you’re trying to establish, then go on to the fact that the statement was missing.]

Q. Officer, good afternoon.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. You just testified that Mario told you he was at the White Castle that night, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. That’s not true, is it?

A. What do you mean?

Q. He never told you that.

A. Yes, counselor, he did.

<b>Step 1: Accredit</b>

Q. How long have you been a police officer? [Note: This is not a leading question, but that’s okay because the answer doesn’t matter.]

A. Five years.

Q. And at the beginning, you had training?

A. Yes.

Q. On how to write police reports?

A. Yes.

Q. Because police reports are important?

A. Yes.

Q. You rely on them to remember exactly what happened?

A. Yes.

Q. The prosecution relies on them when they decide whether to charge a case?

A. I don’t know what the prosecution does with them, counselor.

Q. Well, you submit them to the prosecution?

A. Yes.

Q. And, presumably, they read them?

A. Yes.

Q. And you respect the work they do, don’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you want to help them make the right decisions, don’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. So you try to write good reports?

A. Yes.

Q. And you’ve been trained that a good report is complete?

A. Yes.

Q. You wouldn’t leave anything important out of a report, would you?

A. No. I wouldn’t?

Q. And a good report is accurate?

A. Yes.

Q. You make certain to get everything right?

A. Yes.

Q. And, obviously, your report is truthful?

A. Yes.

Q. You wouldn’t lie. Would you officer?

A. No. I wouldn’t.

Q. And you wrote a complete report in this case, didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. An accurate report?

A. Yes.

Q. A truthful report?

A. Yes.

<b>Step 2: Recommit</b>

Q. It’s your testimony today that Mario told you that he was at the White Castle?

A. Yes. He did tell me that.

<b>Step 3: Confront</b>

Q. Nowhere in your report, officer, does it say that?

<b>Possible Answer 1</b>: No. It does not say that. If you get this answer, you’re done. The officer has been impeached.

<b>Possible Answer 2</b>: Yes. It does say that.

What now? Follow these steps:

1. Mark the report, by writing ∆’s 1 (or whatever number you’re at) on it.
2. Show it to your opponent.
3. Ask the judge to approach the witness.
4. Hand the witness the exhibit and say:

Q.Officer, I’m handing you what I’ve marked as Defendant’s one, for identification. That’s your report, is it not?

A. Yes it is.

Q. Using this red pen, would you please circle where your report says that Mario made that statement?

A. I can’t. It’s not in there.

[You don’t have to do the red pen thing. You can simply say, that statement appears nowhere in your report? But the pen thing is kind of fun. Just be sure that there is nothing in there for the witness to circle!]

<b>Possible Answer 3</b>: I don’t remember what the report says.

No problem. Refresh the witness’ recollection by saying:

Q. You don’t remember what you wrote in your report?

A. Not everything, no.

Q. If I were to show you your report, would that refresh your recollection?

A. Yes.

Now, follow these steps:

1. Mark the exhibit.
2. Show it to your opponent.
3. Ask to approach the witness.
4. Hand the witness the report, and say:

Q. Officer, I’m showing you what I’ve marked as Defendant’s one for identification. Is that your report?

A. Yes.

Q. Take a look at that and let me know when your memory is refreshed.

A. Okay.

Q. Is your memory refreshed?

A. Yes.

Q. Nowhere in that report does it say that Mario told you that he was at the White Castle. Isn’t that true?

A. Yes. That’s not on there.

The witness has been impeached.

<strong>A Sample Cross</strong>

<em>Note: This is an excerpt from a larger cross. It's a little different from a trial cross, because this was done at a hearing on motion to suppress evidence. In this excerpt, there are two points that I'm trying to get across: 1) that the police did not have probable cause to enter Lakesha Moore's apartment, and 2) that Lakesha Moore's consent to let them enter was not voluntary</em>.

Q. Officer, I want to begin by discussing your conversation with with Maurice Nielsen. Understand?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That happened the morning of the 4th?

A. That's correct.

Q. Essentially, Mr. Nielsen told you that he had been beaten by two guys?

A. That's correct.

Q. He told you he didn't know their names, but they went by J.P. and Cleveland.?

A. That's correct.

Q. You didn't know anyone by those nicknames?

A. No, I did not.
Q. Now, did you just testify that you learned those two people lived in the apartment complex?
<em>The goal of my first "chapter" is to establish lack of probable cause by showing that the police had at least two possible addresses for where these attackers might be.</em>

A. He believed they lived there.

Q. And specifically that they lived at 1610 Elm, is that what he told you?

A. No, he did not.

Q. He didn't say that. He told you that he didn't know if they lived there, right?

A. He assumed they lived there.

Q. Didn't he tell you that he saw them in that area alot?

A. Correct.

Q. Be he didn't know exactly which apartment, or even if they lived in the apartment complex?

A. He told me that they lived in the complex.

Q. Didn't he give you two addresses of where they might live?

A. No, he did not.
<em>The officer has gone off-script here. His report says something different from his testimony. This is an opportunity to impeach with a prior inconsistent statement, but you still go through the ARC process (above) because you're impeaching the officer with his own report (as opposed to impeaching him with another witness that you'd call later).</em>

Q. You've been a police officer for what, nine years?

A. Correct.

Q. You're a detective now?

A. I am.

Q. That's a pretty high position in the police department, isn't it?

A. I would guess so.

Q. You've written how many police reports in nine years?

A. Approximately 3 to 400.

Q. Why do you write police reports?

A. To memorialize things that occurred during my investigation.

Q. Is that important?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it important to write truthful reports?
<em>Here, we are entering the "accredit" phase of ARC.</em>

A. Yes.

Q. Is it important to write reports that contain all of the information that might be important to the case?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you write a report in this case?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. In your report, didn't you say that Nielsen told you that either 1610 Elm or 1234 Spruce might be the addresses where the attackers lived?

A. Mr. Nielsen told me that he thought the gentlemen lived at 1610 Elm. However, he often saw them visiting females at 1234 Spruce.
<em>This could have been done better. I skipped over the "recommit" and went straight to the confront. I think I did this because it was a motion and I figured that the judge knew what I was doing. Still, I should have recommitted. Also, the confrontation was sloppy. I should have quoted from the report directly. Now here's a question: what if the officer had denied the contents of the report? What if he had said, "no. My report doesn't say that?" I don't know. Under the rules of your jurisdiction, you might be able to get the report admitted as substantive evidence - if you can at least get the officer to acknowledge that he wrote it. It's an interesting question, but it's never come up in my practice.</em>

Q. That's not what your report says. Doesn't your report say that Nielsen identified 1610 Elm and 1234 Spruce as buildings the subjects might reside in?

A. That's correct.

Q. It doesn't say that the the subjects' girlfriends may reside in? It doesn't say that?

A. No, it doesn't say that.

Q. It says that Mr. Nielsen identified one of two possible buildings where these people might live, right?

A. Correct.

Q. Based on that, you went to the apartment complex office?

A. Correct.

Q. And you got information on 1610 Elm?

A. That's correct.

Q. You didn't get any information on 1234 Spruce?

A. I only asked about 1610 Elm.

Q. You knocked on that door?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, about 90 minutes passed between when you talked to Mr. Nielsen and when you knocked on that door, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. In that time, you applied for zero warrants?

A. Correct.

Q. You've been an officer for many years, haven't you?

A. Yes.

Q. You know how to apply for warrants?

A. Yes.

Q. Nonetheless, you knocked on that door without one?

A. That's correct.

Q. And there were four other police officers with you?
<em>Notice all the leading!</em>

A. Yes.

Q. With guns?

A. Holstered guns, yes.

Q. Lakesha Mooore answered the door?
<em>This is the beginning of chapter 2: Lakesha's consent was involuntary. I probably should have signalled the start of this new chapter by saying something like: Officer, I'm now going to ask you some questions about what happened when Lakesha opened the door.</em>

A. Yes.

Q. And you asked her where J.P. and Cleveland were?

A. Yes.

Q. And she said she didn't know.

A. Yes.

Q. And you told her you were going to apply for a warrant and, if you found them in her apartment, you'd charge her with a crime?

A. I said I would apply for a warrant, and that if I found that she knew they were in the residence, she could be arrested for obstructing justice.

Q. That's a crime, isn't it?

A. It is.

Q. A felony?

A. I believe so.

Q. So, you threatened to send her to prison?
<em>Don't let the witness toy with you. Maintain your control.</em>

Prosecution. Objection: mischaracterization.

The Court. How is that a mischaracterization?

Prosecution. That's not what the officer threatened her with. He did not mention prison.

Defense. Obstructing justice is punishable by a term in prison, Your Honor.

The Court. The question calls for speculation as to what Lakesha Moore would know with regard to the penalties to that offense. On that basis, the objection is sustained.

Q. You threatened her with a crime, because you wanted her to consent to you entry into her apartment. Isn't that true?

A. No.

Q. Well then, why tell here that?
<em>A non-leading question, but I thought it was okay, because the answer is obvious. By asking a leading question here, I'm really just giving the officer rope with which to hang himself. And he did. His answer was ridiculous.</em>

A. Because I knew her from before. I knew that she had no idea what was going on, or I assumed that she possibly had no idea what was going on. I tried to provide her with as much information as I could, and I had some concerns for her and the future of her child.

Q. You told her that she needed to think of her child?

A. Yes.

Q. Why would you tell her that?

A. Because I had concern for her and her child?

Q. Were you suggesting that you were going to take her from her child?

A. No. I was suggesting that if she were arrested, that yes, she may be removed from her child ...

... and so on.
