    <h1>My Record</h1>
    	
    	<p>My jury trial record is below. Note that I'm a defense attorney. Thus, any time the word "guilty" appears below - and it is not preceded by the word "not," well ... that was a sad day in Mudville.</p>

		<p>[All cases were tried in the 18th Judicial Circuit of Illinois.]</p>

<!-- All of the below needs to be re-done as an unordered list. -->
