    <h1>Stress Management</h1>
    
    <!-- Needs to be marked up -->	

    	<em>Do what's good for you, or you're no good for anybody.</em>
<em>-- <a title="Billy Joel: James" href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4gej2mdVcBdUfdxcvhE8rO" target="_blank">Billy Joel</a></em>

Defending people for a living is stressful. Not only are you fighting to preserve someone’s liberty (or life), chances are, you’re doing it for too little pay and with too little time. If you don’t find a way to manage the stress, you’ll burn out. That’s not good for you or your clients.

Here are some of the ways that I cope with the stress of this work. Keep in mind that I’m not a mental health specialist. These are just some things that work for me.

First, you have to stay on top of your workload by keeping organized. If you’re not organized, you’ll get overwhelmed. A large part of the stress of this work comes from the fear that you’re not prepared, or that you forgot to do something. Keeping organized is a big step toward resting easy, knowing that everything is done that needs to be done.

Second, I try to practice mindfulness throughout my day. Although I think “mindfulness” may be an official mental health term, to me, it just means taking time throughout the day to appreciate what’s happening at that moment. [I find that this works best when I’m in nature, but it can happen at any time.]

Third, I get anxious if I don’t maintain a certain level of physical fitness. I don’t aspire to medal at the olympics; I’m just trying to stay fit enough so that I don’t feel old. I rely on two tools for this: kettlebells, and a bicycle.

Finally, I make sure that I make time to do the things that I like to do and be with the people that I like to spend time with. I read, play the guitar, go for long walks, listen to music, have nice dinners, etc.

So this is my recipe for staying sane:

• Organization
• Mindfulness
• Physical Fitness (by means of cycling and kettlebells)
• Fun

<strong>MINDFULNESS</strong>

<em>The dream of my life
Is to lie down by a slow river
And stare at the light in the trees -
To learn something by being nothing
A little while but the rich
Lens of attention</em>

-- from "Entering the Kingdom" by Mary Oliver

<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/tensiontamers/a/exercises.htm" target="_blank">Mindfulness</a> is simply the act of appreciating the now. I love to go out into nature. I consider the sky and the birds. I feel the sun and the wind. I listen.

But, one doesn’t have to be outside to be mindful. In the car on the way to work, you can enjoy the feel of the forward motion. You can enjoy the sky. You can enjoy the sensation of being alive. Just pay attention to what’s happening at that moment, and listen for its music.

Speaking of which, I find that listening to certain music helps me deal with stress.

There is a remarkable piece called <a title="Ann Southam: Simple Lines of Enquiry" href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4F9Jl5QMWUScaJmPwYepZW" target="_blank"><em>Simple Lines of Enquiry</em></a> by Canadian composer Ann Southam, for example, that is a virtual exercise in mindfulness. If you have some time, put this on, dim the lights, and just listen to the sound of the piano. Listen how each note relates to its neighbor.

I also am addicted to the music of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/02/05/070205crmu_music_ross?currentPage=all" target="_blank">Toru Takmitsu</a>. Structured around silence, this music aims to create moments of contemplation. Listening to these compositions is like strolling through a Japanese garden, where you’re supposed to pause along the way to ponder where you’ve been and where you’re going.

Two of my favorite Takemitsu pieces, <em>The Night </em>from<em> Toward the Sea</em> and <em>Then I Knew 'Twas Wind</em>, can be found<em> </em><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105927495" target="_blank">here</a>. [The Debussy pieces are also magnificent.] Guitarist John Williams also has <a title="Williams plays Takemitsu" href="http://open.spotify.com/track/1Kti2rNIIwbkf85flrTu3W" target="_blank">another favorite Takemitsu album</a>.

In addition to music, I look to poetry for inspiration, guidance, calm, and company. Whitman is a favorite, of course. [I kept <em><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/142/105.html" target="_blank">You Felons on Trial in Courts</a></em> on my wall at work for a time.] Also, Mary Oliver’s <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/0-8070-6877-2" target="_blank">New and Selected Poems, Volume 1</a></em>, is filled with many gems, like <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16CL6bKVbJQ" target="_blank">The Summer Day</a></em>.

<strong>CYCLING</strong>

A while ago, I started thinking about cycling to work. I figured that it would be good for my budget, my health, and the environment. Then, I came across two things that convinced me to give it a try.

The first was Grant Petersen’s book <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/978-0-7611-5558-4" target="_blank">Just Ride</a></em>, which is written, he says, for the “unracer.” It’s worth a read. The overarching point of it is that modern cycling has become infected with considerations that really only apply to bike racers, which most of us aren’t. Petersen says don’t worry about what fabrics you wear, or using special shoes, or your cycling cadence, or whatever. Just get on the bike and ride. Riding should be fun.

The second thing that I came across was <a href="http://lovelybike.blogspot.com/2010/10/lovely-bicycle-on-budget-vintage-vs.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, where I read about taking an old bike with a good frame and updating it for everyday riding.

Inspired, I decided that I was going to do it.

So, I got on craigslist, bought an old Raleigh touring frame for $150, took it to my local bike shop and got new tires, tubes, and a tuneup for another $150 and bought about $100 worth of gear. So, for under $500 I was good to go.

[The gear included a bell, which is fabulous, and a saddlebag. I also got a helmet, but, frankly, I almost never wear it.]

And go I do. I ride at least once a week, and it’s beautiful time. I don’t race or push it. I pedal, listen to the whirr of the cassette, and daydream.

I look forward to my bike rides and their wonderful solitude.

<strong>KETTLEBELLS</strong>

I first encountered kettlebells a few years ago, when I was doing CrossFit. They're my favorite workout tool because they're simple and efficient. For further thoughts on them, <a title="Kettlebell Rodeo" href="http://www.jaimeescuder.com/category/kettlebell-rodeo/">click here</a>.

<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>

Stay fit. Stay calm. Value your happiness.

This job will kill you if you let it. Don't let it.
