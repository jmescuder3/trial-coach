    <h1>Opening Statement</h1>
 
    <!-- Needs to be paragraphed -->


<em>Get it right the first time, that's the main thing.
-- <a title="Billy Joel: Get It Right the First Time" href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6rEJ6ncZKq9EM3TwyMhTDo" target="_blank">Billy Joel</a></em>

Opening statement is one of the most important phases of the trial. In my opinion, it’s even more important than closing argument because, by the time closing argument rolls around, most of the jurors will have already made up their minds.

[This, of course, they will be told <em>not </em>to do, but most of them will do it anyway, just like they will hold it against your client if he doesn’t testify. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the instruction that tells them to apply the law, even if they disagree with it. <em>That</em> they adhere to.]

The opening statement’s power is derived from its position at the front of the trial. While it’s true that, in <em>voir dire</em>, you may have been able to refer to certain aspects of your case, in opening statement you get to tell your client’s story <em>as</em> a story. Capitalize on this critical moment by telling a memorable story that favorably explains the evidence that the jury is about to hear. You do this by telling a compelling, fact-driven story that is interwoven with your theme and your theory. Also, fight for control of the conversation by assigning labels to some of the more important people and events associated with your trial.

This is all done with the ultimate goal of convincing the jurors that, despite the fact that the prosecution goes first, you have a story they should look forward to. So, be interesting. Be entertaining. Be outraged. Let the jury know that the prosecution isn’t the only player in the courtroom.

Also, be informative. Don’t be vague. [Unless it’s a driving while license suspended case or something, and you really have nothing to say. In that case, your only hope might to be vague and then hope that something unexpectedly breaks your way at trial.] Educate the jury as to where the fight is. Are you claiming that your client is not guilty on all counts, period? Are you trying for a lesser included offense? Are you saying that your client is guilty of some, but not all, of the charges? Alert the jury as to what evidence matters, and what is merely the prosecution’s window-dressing.

Given that you are not allowed to argue in opening, acheiving all of these goals may seem unrealistic. It’s not. A thoughtfully constructed fact-driven narrative can be just as persuasive as any closing argument. If done properly, when you finish your opening, the jury should know your story, and they should be prepared to incorporate the evidence into your version of events.

[To see it in action, take a look at the sample opening below.]<strong>

Compel With a Fact-Driven Narrative

</strong><em>Show Don't Tell
-- <a title="Rush: Show Don't Tell" href="http://open.spotify.com/track/7kyZkuQ6syH7mvANlbJiXe" target="_blank">Neil Peart</a></em>

You’re not allowed to argue in opening statement. Some attorneys struggle with this restriction. I think this is because they’re unclear by what is meant by the term “argument.”

I think of argument as being any explanatory commentary that I make with regard to the facts. In other words, in opening, state the facts, don’t comment on them. Let’s look at this a little more closely to see what I mean.

Let’s say that you lost your motion to suppress statements. As a result, your client’s confession is coming in. At trial, you want to argue that the confession is false - your client just made it because the police threatened to charge his girlfriend if he didn’t implicate himself in the crime.

In opening, you say, “Officer Jones then told James that he would charge Stephanie if James didn’t sign the confession.” This is proper, because it’s a fact.

After this, however, you further say, “When James heard this, he felt hopeless. He felt like the world was closing in on him. There was nothing he could do but sign the confession.”

You can’t say this in opening, because it’s argument. [You <em>can</em> say it in closing, of course.] These are not facts. These are inferences that you have drawn from the fact that James’ girlfriend was threatened.

So, what to do? The answer: show don’t tell. State facts that would lead the jury to arrive at the conclusion that you’re trying to make on their own.

Like this:

“Officer Jones then told James that he would charge Stephanie if James didn’t sign the confession. James said, ‘Stephanie had nothing to do with this.’ Officer Jones said, ‘Oh yes she did. It was her car. She’s accountable, same as you.’”

When he heard that, James started to sweat. He asked for a cigarette. Officer Jones said ‘no.’ James asked to go outside for some air. Officer Jones said ‘no.’ Officer Jones pushed the paper closer. He leaned forward and looked James in the eye. ‘Do the right thing,’ he said. ‘Tell me what really happened.’”

As you can see, these are all facts, but they’re colorful facts. They paint the picture that you want the jury to draw (James felt hopeless) without actually saying, “James felt hopeless.”

[As an aside, I would note that using facts like this can be very powerful. It puts juries in the middle of the scene in a way that simply saying “James was afraid” doesn’t. It paints a picture. It’s as though the jury is watching a movie of what you’re describing. For that reason, a well-crafted opening can be just as powerful a tool of persuasion as any closing argument.]

<h1>Construct a Story That Will Start a Fire of Outrage</h1>
In addition to the trick of avoiding argument, there is also the question of how to construct your statement so that it states your theme and successfully lays out your theory. The principles of opening statement construction are pretty simple, however: tell a story that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Make sure that it flows logically. Work through the events chronologically, pausing to discuss particular people or events along the way.

Finally, remember that the jurors expect to be entertained. They’ll never admit this, of course, but they’re used to television. They want drama. Tell an <em>interesting </em>story. Get their attention. When you’re through, they should feel a spark of outrage starting to develop in their bellies.

<strong>Themes
</strong><b>
</b>What exactly <em>is</em> a theme? I like <a href="http://blog.nolo.com/criminallaw/" target="_blank">Paul Bergman’s explanation</a> [from Trial Advocacy in a Nutshell]: “A theme conveys the message that beneath all the testimonial complexity is a simple truth that merits a favorable verdict.”

My definition is simply this: A trial theme answers the question: why is the defendant on trial? In the context of a criminal case, another way to ask this question is: why is the prosecution accusing an innocent man (or, if you’re trying for a lesser included: why is the prosecution accusing this man of more crimes than the ones that he actually committed?)?

Notice that the prosecution always and instantly has a great answer to the question why is the defendant on trial. Their answer is: because he’s guilty. When they flesh out their themes, they look to answer the further question of: why did the defendant commit the crime? In answering this question, they look to the great human motivations: greed, fear, anger, lust, vengeance, etc. Defense lawyers should do the same. After all, jurors understand these motivations. The difference is, instead of attributing these motivations to the defendant, a defense lawyer attributes them elsewhere, such as to the police, or a jilted lover.

For example, your theme might be that your client’s ex-wife wants to profit in their divorce, and so she’s falsely accusing him of domestic battery (greed). Or that she’s upset that he has re-married (jealousy).

Perhaps, you have a murder case and your argument is that, in an effort to close the case quickly and satisfy the public outcry, the police framed your client (corruption, political pressure, fear). Perhaps the police just got the wrong man (laziness, incompetence). Perhaps the prosecution is overcharging your client because they’re so outraged at his conduct (vengeance). The possibilities are endless.

Just remember that the purpose of the theme is to provide a framework for the evidence, so that the jury can understand what it means in the larger context of your story.

Let’s say, for example, the prosecution spends three days putting on DNA evidence. If, in your opening statement, you explained this evidence by saying, for example, that the sex was consensual and the girl is just now changing her story because she learned that your client was cheating on her with someone else (vengeance) then the jury will understand that, despite the length of time the prosecution has chosen to spend on it, this evidence is not really significant to the central issues in the case. If, however, you don’t set forth your theme in opening, the jury might assign too much importance to this evidence.

<h1>Where to Find Themes</h1>
Themes are everywhere. They form the framework for all art that relies on a narrative structure. Look for them in novels, movies, TV shows, and your own life. Try to pick some favorite books and movies and distill them down into a one word theme. Sometimes it’s easy, because the title will tell you (<em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>). Other times it will be more difficult. Sometimes, there can be multiple themes. At times, <em>Star Wars </em>can be said to be about reconciliation, revenge, oppression, liberation, and more. [I’m talking about the original movies, of course. Please don’t ever mention those later abominations in my presence.]

There is no right answer. Pick the theme that resonates the most with you.

<strong>Theories</strong>

Whereas your theme explains why your client is on trial (someone else’s greed, dishonesty, corruption, etc.) your theory explains how it happened. It identifies the moments, decisions, people, and actions that caused your client to find himself in the trial chair.

Let’s say, for example, that your defense is that your client was arrested because of a shoddy police investigation and the prosecution’s over-reliance on an unreliable eyewitness. These mistakes can be boiled down into several different themes, including incompetence, corruption, and confusion. But how do these themes reveal themselves in the evidence? That is your theory.

For example, let’s say your client is charged with murder, but there is another suspect who was never arrested and who is just as likely to have committed the crime. Your theory could be that the police botched the investigation by:

• failing to follow leads that pointed to the other suspect
• failing to preserve potentially exonerating evidence
• relying too much on the statement of an eye witness
• assuming your client's guilty just because he was found near the crime scene

As evidence of each of these comes out at trial, say, for example, by bringing out that the other suspect had a violent history, or by cross examining on the fact that the police failed to try to match a shoeprint that was found at the scene to the shoes that were being worn by the other potential suspect, you bring your theory to life.

<hr />

<h1>Marry Your Theory to Your Theme</h1>
Note that it is not enough to simply have a theory. A theory only works if it is married to a theme. Thus, you must provide an explanation for why things happened the way they did in order for your story to be credible.

In other words, it’s not enough to simply show that the police botched the investigation, you must also show <em>why</em> they botched. Perhaps they were poorly trained. Perhaps they were under political pressure to solve the case quickly. Perhaps they had a history with your client and didn’t like him. Whatever.

There are many possible themes. Choose the one that resonates with you the most given the particulars of your case and explain how your theory bears it out. It is through the unification of your theme with your theory that your story evolves from the disingenuous rants of a sleazy defense attorney, into reasonable doubt.

<strong>Labels
</strong>
<em>You labeled me. I'll label you.
-- <a title="Metallica: Unforgiven" href="http://open.spotify.com/track/5SnOyuBtyzufoXBAKOdcxD" target="_blank">Metallica</a></em>

Labels are the terms that you assign to the various people, events and whatever else in the courtroom.

Here’s my favorite example of a “label war:”

My client was accused of breaking into his former lawyer’s house for the purpose of stealing items to sell for drugs. Things got out of hand and my client, allegedly, strangled the lawyer to death. The murder happened on the second floor of the home and, in order to get his lawyer up there, my client had to place the lawyer [notice, I refuse to call him the “victim”], who was in poor health, into one those electric-powered chairs that disabled persons use to ascend stairs.

Throughout the trial, the prosecution referred to this device as the “electric chair.” As in: Officer, what did the defendant tell you he did after he strapped Mr. Smith to the electric chair? And so on.

We, on the defense, however, preferred to call this the “mobility chair.” As in: Officer, isn’t it true that James secured Mr. Smith in the mobility chair so that Mr. Smith wouldn’t fall out and injure himself?

This may seem like a small thing (hey, when ya got lemons...), but I wasn’t about to allow the prosecutor to own this piece of evidence in that way.

Anyway, prosecutors love using labels. You can use labels too. Here are some ideas on how to strike back:

Instead of the defendant, the accused, or Mr. Smith, or, simply, James.

Instead of the victim, the complaining witness.

Instead of the People or the government, the prosecution.

Instead of the confession, the statement.

The Prosecution Says: The Electric Chair, The Defendant, The Victim, The People, The Confession.

The Defense Says: The Mobility Chair, Jimmy, The Complaining Witness, The Prosecution, The Statement.

<b>Finally, avoid using legal terms or trial labels that the jurors probably don’t know. for example, instead of saying “on direct, you testified …”, say, “when Mr. Jones was questioning you, you said …”

</b>Labels are simple, yet powerful tools. They can help to give you ownership over the conversation. Don’t just concede the right to name things to the prosecution. Use labels to claim possession over some of the language in the courtroom.

<strong>A Sample Opening</strong>

Philip Moore robbed his lawyer, Mack Johnson. But, ladies and gentlemen, he <em>didn’t </em>kill him. After Philip left, or maybe even before Philip entered that house, Mr. Johnson died in his sleep, of natural causes.
<em>
[Note the absence of "may it please the court, or any of that thanking counsel nonsense. The jury pays the most attention to the first words out of your mouth. Don't waste them. Start your story right away.] </em>

The prosecution wants you to believe that this is a case about greed and anger. You know what? They’re right. It <em>is</em> a case about greed. Philip stole from Mr. Johnson, and that was wrong and that was greedy.

<em>[These two paragraphs are argument, but it's okay. Most judges will let you argue a little a the beginning of your statement, as you set forth your theme. If the judge shuts you down, no problem. Just jump right into the story.]</em>

And, it <em>is</em> a case about anger. But, not Philip’s. The prosecution is angry. They’re angry that Philip entered that house that day. And that anger has blinded them to the evidence that Mr. Johnson died simply because it was his time. Instead, it has caused them to charge him with a crime that he did not commit. Let’s see why.

Philip woke up that morning, and he was drug sick. Philip does drugs, ladies and gentlemen, and, as you’ll see, those drugs have taken control of his life.

Philip was sick and penniless. He needed drugs, but he had nothing to buy them with, and he immediately thought of Mr. Johnson, his lawyer, who was known for his expensive watch collection.

So, Philip went to that house, broke in, stole the watches, and left. He didn’t see Mr. Johnson when he was there, he didn’t touch Mr. Johnson while he was there.

<em>[By admitting guilt to the robbery right away, you define where the fight is for the jury. No doubt, the prosecution will spend a lot of time proving up the robbery - which is no longer in contention. This may cause the jury to think that the prosecution is avoiding the real question in the case: how did the victim die?]</em>

Now, ladies and gentlemen, you’re going to hear that Mr. Johnson was not a well man. He was elderly, he had heart problems, he had lung problems, he was obese. In fact, he rarely left his house. In <em>fact</em>, he rarely went downstairs because he couldn’t carry himself down. Instead, he had one of those mobility chairs that carries people down, but it’s slow going, and so Mr. Johnson mostly stayed upstairs in his bedroom and his housekeeper would bring him meals up there.

And that’s where he was when Philip broke in to take the watches and that’s where his body found when the housekeeper came home. She saw signs of a break-in and called the police. They found Philip’s fingerprints and they jumped to conclusions. They just assumed that whoever robbed Mr. Johnson also killed him. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s not the case.

<em>[Refering to another theme: shoddy police work.]</em>

You’re going to hear that there is no evidence at all that firmly establishes that Mr. Johnson was killed by anyone. You’re going to hear from a coroner who will say that Mr. Johnson was strangled to death, but you’re also going to hear that, at the end of her autopsy, that was <em>not</em> her opinion. Mr. Johnson’s heart was so bad, she initially thought that he died of a heart attack. It wasn’t until after she read the police reports and learned that Philip confessed that she decided to call this case a homicide.

<em>[And let’s talk about that confession. Yes, Philip said he strangled Mr. Johnson, but that was only after the police threatened to charge his girlfriend with murder if Philip didn’t confess.]</em>

Departing from the chronological order of things, but it's okay, as the confession must be addressed.

You see, Stephanie drove Philip to Mr. Johnson’s that day. She thought he was going to talk about a case. She didn’t know that he was going there to steal. She waited in the car the whole time. Nonetheless, the police threatened to charge her with murder, so Philip said that he strangled Mr. Johnson, even though there’s no evidence of it.

Ladies and gentlemen, Philip is guilty of robbery. He admits that. He’s always admitted it. He did not, however, kill Frederic Johnson. That’s why, at the end of this case, we’re going to ask you to find Philip not guilty of murder.

<em>[Again, defining the fight. End by telling the jurors what you want them to do.]</em>
