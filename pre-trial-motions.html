    <h1>Pre-Trial Motions</h1>

<!-- Needs to be paragraphed -->

Often, after you prepare an individual file, the following will happen: you will close the file, look out the window, and think “this guy is screwed.” You see no defenses, the client confesses, the drugs were found in his pocket, etc. Don’t give up. Instead, go back. Look for pre-trial motions.

<em>Anything</em> can be the basis of a pre-trial motion. You are limited only by your imagination and the requirement that all motions be made in good-faith. So, look at the grand jury transcript - was there any misconduct? Look at the search warrant - did it particularly describe the place to be searched? Look at the indictment - does it state an offense? Are there speedy trial issues? Jurisdiction issues? Compulsory joinder issues? Anything that you legitimately believe to be a problem can be challenged.

Having said that, in criminal cases two particular areas generally provide most of the fodder for pre-trial motions. These are your client’s arrest and his subsequent interrogation - should your client have been un-streetsmart enough to have talked to the police. As a result, I'm going to spend a little time talking about both motions to quash arrest and suppress evidence, and motions to suppress statements.

Before I begin though, you may be wondering why you should bother with filing motions in the first place.

Motions offer many benefits. [Keep in mind, however, that you can only file a motion that is legally justified. You have an ethical obligation to avoid frivolous motions. <em>All</em> motions must be filed in good faith.]

They include:

• Potentially weakening the prosecution's case.

• Failing that, preserving the issue for appeal.

• Using the filing of the motion as leverage during plea negotiations.

• Locking the witnesses in to sworn testimony before trial.

• Educating the judge as to the facts of your case.

This last reason deserves a little more discussion.

Until now, the prosecution has had a monopoly on telling the judge the story of this case. They drew up the indictments and, if there was a bond hearing, they told the judge their theory of the offense. Motions give you the opportunity to lay out the facts as the defense sees them.

For this reason, I never file boilerplate motions. Never. Don’t miss this opportunity to slow some of the prosecution’s momentum.

There’s another reason not to file boilerplate motions: judges don’t take them seriously. If a judge sees that counsel has taken the time to craft a well-written motion specifically for that case, he or she is likely to give it more attention than they would a motion that is obviously copied and pasted.

On a related topic, be judicious with your filings. Only file motions that are justified. If you file motions on every case, the judge will give them little consideration. If, however, you are known for only filing motions when there is a genuine legal issue, the judges will take note of your filings.

Finally, a <em>caveat</em>. Do not take what I say here as gospel. I offer the information on the following pages solely as my own approach to tackling these types of motions. Start there, but don’t stop there. Run the facts of your case by your colleagues. Question my recitation of the law. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the law has changed since I wrote this. This is not law school, this is a website. Treat it accordingly and do your own research.

Also, it goes without saying that I’m talking only to lawyers. If you’re a non-lawyer who thinks you can defend yourself on your DUI case by reading this, don’t be silly. Hire a competent lawyer who knows the law of your jurisdiction.

And now, look below if you’d like a very brief overview of the law surrounding Fourth Amendment seizures and tips on how to litigate motions to quash arrest.

Or, look further down to learn about the law surrounding <em>Miranda</em> and how to neutralize the confession.

<strong>The Fourth Amendment
</strong>
Don't rely on what is said here. Instead, I want you to do your own research. Thus, I offer only a very brief overview of the law in this area followed by my own approach to litigating motions to suppress under the Fourth Amendment. That amendment, as you know, prevents “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

[I’m not going to talk about searches right now, except to say that the general rule is that warrantless searches are unlawful unless they fall into one of a number of exceptions. These exceptions include consent, search incident to arrest, plain view, inventory searches, exigent circumstances, and others. Each of these exceptions has built up its own body of law defining its limits. Consent, for example, must be voluntary. Thus, if a police officer points a gun at someone and says “open your purse, or I pull the trigger” any contraband found thereafter probably would not be considered to be the product of valid consent. You should familiarize yourself with your particular jurisdiction’s interpretation of these exceptions.]

<h1><em>Terry</em> Stops and Reasonable Suspicion</h1>
There are generally two types of seizures: <em>Terry </em>stops and arrests. <em>Terry </em>stops [the name comes from the case of <em>Terry v. Ohio</em>, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)] can be seen as brief detentions. More than that, I can’t really say, as courts look at several different factors before determining whether something rises to the level of, or exceeds, a <em>Terry</em> stop. What I <em>can</em> say is that a <em>Terry </em>stop is less restrictive than an arrest.

<em>Because</em> it is less restrictive, a <em>Terry </em>stop requires a smaller quantum of evidence before a police officer can engage in one. In order for an arrest to be lawful, the police need “probable cause.” A <em>Terry</em> stop, however, only requires a “reasonable suspicion” that a crime has been, or will be, committed.

As to what constitutes a reasonable suspicion, I again can’t say, as courts look to several factors. What I <em>can</em> say, is that in order for an officer to achieve reasonable suspicion, they need less evidence than they would for probable cause, but they also need to have more than a hunch. Thus, if an officer stops your client simply because he’s wearing a blue shirt in a high crime area, you probably should file a motion alleging the officer stopped your client without a reasonable suspicion that your client had committed a crime. If the officer knew that a blue-shirted person had recently committed a robbery nearby, however, the question gets closer.

In addition to <em>Terry </em>stops, the police can perform <em>Terry </em>searches. Typically, a <em>Terry</em> search invloves a par-down. Note that a <em>Terry</em> search is a search for weapons - not evidence. A police officer cannot engage in one unless he is in reasonable apprehension of his safety. After the pat-down, if the officer does not feel anything that seems to be a weapon, no further searching is allowed. Thus, if the officer pats your client down and feel a powdery bulge in his pocket, he cannot pull it out of your client's pocket simply because he suspect that it’s drugs. He can only remove an item that he reasonable believe to be a weapon.

So, to summarize, a <em>Terry </em>stop is a brief detention by the police that has to be supported by more than a hunch, but requires less than probable cause. It can include a pat-down for weapons, if the officer is in reasonable fear for his or her safety.

<h1>Arrests and Probable Cause</h1>
An arrest occurs when the police place an actual restraint on your client’s liberty. Exactly what this means can vary, depending on the case. Obviously, the more constraints the police place on your client, the more likely it is that a court will find an arrest to have occurred. If your client is handcuffed and placed in the back of a squad car, for example, that’s a pretty good indicator of arrest. If the police simply tell your client to “come here,” it’s less clear.

What <em>is</em> clear is that the Fourth Amendment forbids the police from arresting someone without probable cause. Your particular jurisdiction may define it, but all I can tell you is that probable cause requires more proof than is necessary for reasonable suspicion, but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt (which, of course, is the standard that is required to actually find someone guilty of a crime).

And that, in very broad strokes, lays out the law governing Fourth Amendment seizures. As a defense attorney, the question then becomes how to marshal it for your motion to quash arrest.

For starters, the title “Motion to Quash Arrest” is a bit of a misnomer. You can’t quash the arrest - it’s already happened. What you are really seeking to do is suppress evidence that was discovered as the result of what you are alleging was an unlawful arrest. Still, I use the title “Motion to Quash Arrest and Suppress Evidence” because it instantly tells the judge what I'm challenging - the arrest. “Motion to Suppress Evidence” also works, but it’s a little less clear, since there are many bases to move to suppress evidence other than an unlawful arrest.

<strong>Motions to Quash Arrest</strong>

In order to prevail on a motion to quash arrest, you must establish that the arrest or stop was in fact unlawful.

How do you do that? Here are two possible ways: you can argue that the client was stopped without reasonable suspicion, or you can argue that he was arrested without probable cause.

Let’s take reasonable suspicion first.

The first task is to establish that your client was stopped. If he wasn’t, it doesn’t matter whether the police had any evidence at all, and the motion dies. The test for this, was set forth by the Supreme Court in <a title="Mendenhall" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17693639495652176381&amp;q=Mendenhall&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,14&amp;scilh=0" target="_blank"><em>United States v. Mendenhall</em></a>, 446 U.S. 544 (1980), when it stated that a person is seized when “in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.”

So, look for cases in your jurisdiction that are factually similar to your situation and that have favorable holdings. Then, argue that the police simply didn’t have enough information before they stopped your client. Point out all of the innocent reasons why your client might have been behaving in what the police believed to be suspicious behavior.

The same type of process applies to the arrest cases. First, establish that your client was under arrest. I always look for the handcuffs. Once those go on, it’s difficult for the State to argue that your client was not under arrest. You then have to argue that, at that moment, the police lacked probable cause.

My secret to arguing both of these types of motions is to argue that the seizure, or the arrest, happened as late in the police interaction as possible - just before the police find, or your client says, whatever it is that has damned him. The longer that you wait in the interaction before alleging the seizure, the more police questions, pat-downs, and whatever else will have occurred, bolstering your argument that your client felt like he was in custody.

Wait too long though (for example, if you argue that the arrest didn’t happen until your client said “okay, I admit it. Those are my drugs.”) and you give the prosecution enough evidence to establish probable cause.

So, the trick is to find the sweet spot in the interaction where the police conduct establishes a maximum of custodial-type actions with a minimum of evidence.

<b>You’re the big winner. Now what?</b>

Congratulations. But don’t get carried away. Typically, motions that are granted only apply to evidence that is directly derived from the unlawful stop or arrest. If the prosecution can show that it would have discovered the evidence anyway, or that it was attenuated from the illegal conduct, the evidence can still come in. Depending on the circumstances, the prosecution may also be able to use the suppressed evidence in their rebuttal case.

But, make no mistake: winning a motion is a good thing for your client. See if you can use the win to get a better offer.

<b>You’re the big loser. Now what?</b>

Don’t feel bad. Motions are hard to win - especially on cases with serious charges. It shouldn’t be that way, but it is.

Plus, even if you lose, remember the benefits to filing a motion that I mentioned above.

<strong>Neutralizing the Confession

</strong><em>Don't get any big ideas. They're [probably] not gonna happen.
-- <a title="Radiohead: Nude" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxvsq-IluaA" target="_blank">Radiohead</a></em>

Sorry, but here's the reality: judges don't get elected/retained etc., by suppressing evidence. Run your motion, but don’t get your hopes up. Chances are, that confession is coming in.

<hr />

<b>Oh no! The Confession is Coming In! Now What?</b>

First, don’t panic. You have options. Here are a couple:

1. Incorporate the confession into your theory of the case.

Is the confession really that bad? Can you work with it? Can you tell a story of innocence that includes the confession?

2. Claim that the confession was false.

False confessions happen. As the number of persons exonerated by DNA increases, the general public is becoming more and more aware of this problem. <em><a title="Voir Dire" href="http://www.jaimeescuder.com/voir-dire/" target="_blank">Voir dire</a></em> on it. See if you can get a jury that is receptive to the notion. Then, cross the cop on the interrogation techniques that he employed on your client.

Most cops use The Reid Technique of interrogation. [You can find details on it <a title="The Reid Technique" href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/police-interrogation.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.] Cross on that. Many jurors will be surprised - and upset - by the deceptive and coercive practices that the police use during many interrogations.

[Of course,if you get the chance to take a Reid course, do. Knowledge of the technique can lead to some blistering cross examinations of the interrogating officer. (For a sample Reid cross, click <a title="The Reid Technique" href="http://www.jaimeescuder.com/a-sample-cross-on-the-reid-technique/" target="_blank">here</a>.)]

You can also claim that your client lied during the interrogation because he thought he’d get some benefit from it: a reduced charge, a better deal for his girlfriend, whatever.

Trying a case with a confession is hard. There’s no question about it. Lucky for your client, his lawyer is ingenious.
