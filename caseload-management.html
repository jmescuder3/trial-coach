    <h1>Caseload Management</h1>

    	<p>If you’re a public defender, you’re overworked. You have too many files and you make too little money. No doubt, this will all have changed by the time Justice Scalia writes an opinion finding something to be cruel. Until then, you’re going to have to cope. But, you don’t have to suffer. There <em>are</em> ways to manage a mammoth caseload.</p>

		<p>[And what do I mean by mammoth? In my early days, when I was in a misdemeanor courtroom, my caseload hovered near 400 active files. I had between 25 and 35 cases set for trial each week. That felt mammoth. If your situation is worse, I feel for you. I really do.]</p>

		<p>The first important thing to recognize is that there are two aspects to managing a caseload. The first is the global aspect; you have to keep control over <em>all</em> of your files. You have to know where they are, and you have to develop a system that ensures that you don’t miss deadlines on any of them. I call this "global caseload management."</p>

		<p>Second, you have to have a system of "individual file preparation," so that you can identify the files that require extra work. By combining global caseload management with individual file preparation, you ensure that each file is ready for the next court date.</p>

		<p>Do not underestimate the importance of organization. You can’t be an effective defense attorney if you’re constantly trying to do things at the last minute. Your work will be rushed, the quality will suffer, and the judges will notice. Then, you'll be called into your boss's office and asked if everything is okay at home. You don't want that.</p>

		<p>Also, don't delude yourself into thinking that the world will accomodate your trial schedule, or anything else. Trials don’t happen in a vacuum. You know those T.V. shows where somebody comes across a body behind a dumpster somewhere, and for the next hour of the show it's as though the entire police department and judicial system has nothing else to do but work on that one case?</p>

		<p>That’s not real life. In real life, while you’re preparing one case for trial, you also have to manage your responsibilities to your other clients, your family (including your mother, who would like you to return her phone call), and whatever else.</p>

		<p>If you don't have a system, you'll be overwhelmed. By adopting some kind of a system, you increase the chance that you’ll be able to weather the surges of your practice. This will save you lots of stress. Trust me.</p>

		<p>Finally, by no means is this system the only one. It’s just what’s worked for me. The important thing is not necessarily to adopt this system. The important thing is to recognize that you need a system of caseload management.</p>

	<h2>Global Caseload Management</h2>

		<p>My method of global caseload management relies upon placing files in various locations in your office, based on their level of doneness. It's meant to be used in conjunction with individual file preparation.</p>

		<p>For files that still require some work, I employ three desk surfaces. The desk in my office is formed in a rough semicircle, or C. [You don’t need to have your desk in this shape. The important thing is the number of surfaces.] One side of the C is my war space. This is where I work on the case that is next up for trial. I aim to keep this area free of anything that is not related to that specific case. Typically this area is covered with police reports, jury instructions, caselaw, and my notes.</p>

		<p>Next to this, in the curve of the C, is my computer space. This is where I research and write motions. My phone is also here. I have a swivel chair and it’s an easy task to switch between the trial space and the computer, as I need to research, type out cross examination chapters, or whatever.</p>

		<p>The third surface is my “To Do” space. It has three piles of files on it:

			<ul>
				<li>Pile 1. Clients that I need to speak with/visit in the jail.</li>
				<li>Pile 2. Files that I need to do something on, such as write a motion or draft a subpoena.</li>
				<li>Pile 3. Unread files.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2>Use Different Office Areas to Stay Organized</h2>

		<p>In addition to these desk surfaces, I keep files in an upright file-holder and in a file cabinet.</p>

		<p>The file-holder contains all files with an upcoming trial or hearing date. The files are in chronological order with the soonest court date at the front.</p>

		<p>This last detail is important; the files with the soonest court datesMUST be at the top of the piles, and at the front of your trial holder! That way, you can glance at the top file and see what is most pressing.</p>

		<p>The file cabinet is where I store files that are prepared. I never put a file in the cabinet unless it is 100% ready for court. If you put a file that still requires work in the file cabinet, you’ll forget about it until it’s too late.</p>

		<p>[Sometimes, files are ready and become unready. For example, if you set a case for sentencing and you’re awaiting the return of a pre-sentence investigation, it’s okay to put the file in the cabinet until the report arrives. Once it arrives though, take the file out and place it in pile 2 until you’ve read the PSI, done whatever work is required, and are ready for sentencing. Don’t simply put the PSI in your file and then return the file, unread, to your cabinet. The cabinet really needs to be a place that holds only files that require absolutely no further work.]</p>

		<p>The aim of this caseload management system is to get files from undone (the desk surfaces) to done (the upright file-holder or file cabinet) as fast as possible.</p>

	<h2>Global Caseload Management In Action</h2>

		<p>Here’s how my caseload management system looks in action:</p>

		<p>After a busy morning in court, you return to your office and find a bunch of new files in your mailbox. Take them to your office, organize them chronologically, and put them in pile 3. Make sure that the file with the soonest court date is no top. Sit down and read that file, applying the micro-management system.</p>

		<p>Depending on what the file requires, put it in pile 2 if you need to file a motion or investigate, pile 1 if you need to talk to the client, or, if nothing needs to be done, the file-holder or cabinet, depending on whether the next date is a hearing or trial. (This is unlikely if the file is brand new.)</P>

		<p>Be sure not to neglect any of the piles. Don’t exclusively focus on pile 3, for example, and then go to court to discover that you’ve forgotten the top file from pile 2 in your office – and that you haven’t written the motion to suppress that you were supposed to file that day. Instead, look at the top file on all three piles. Which one has the soonest court date? That’s the one you need to work on next.</p>

	<h2>Individual File Preparation</h2>

		<p>This system of individual file preparation is designed to make sure that no individual file gets neglected. It's meant to be used in conjunction with global caseload management. Here's how it looks in action:</p>

		<p>After a busy morning in court, you come back to the office to find a bunch of new files in your mailbox. How should these be processed so that you maintain caseload management, while at the same time ensuring that these individual files are prepared for trial?</p>

		<p>Take the files back to your office and place them chronologically into pile 3, with the files with the soonest court date on top. Now, pick up the file on top of pile 3 and get to work.</p>

	<h2>A Tri-Color Scheme For Preparing Files</h2>

		<p>The first time I read through a new file, I simply read, while also employing a tri-color system of highlighting.</p>

		<p>I highlight in Green anything that strikes me as possibly important. Names of witnesses, particular observations by police, client statements, whatever.</p>

		<p>Blue is used for anything that I’m missing. For example, if the discovery says something like “see Officer Larsen’s supplemental report for further,” or “this interview was videotaped,” I highlight that. As I’m continuing through the file and find that I’ve been tendered Officer Larsen’s supplemental, I return to the earlier blue highlight and put a check through my prior marking. If, after reading all the reports, there are any unchecked blue spots, I email the prosecutor asking for what’s missing. I <strong>print this email(!)</strong> and place it in the file. I also make a blue mark on the front of the file - V for video, R for report, or a dash for something else - so that by glancing at the file, I can immediately tell what is missing. If I don’t need the missing something before the next court date, I put the file in my cabinet. If I do need it, I put the file in pile 2.</p>

		<p>Pink is used to mark anything in the discovery that I need to list in a motion in limine prior to trial. Typically, these are things that I want to keep out at trial, but were not obtained as a result of the investigation into my client, and thus, are not generally appropriate for a pre-trial motion.</p>

		<p>For example, if the reports contain my client’s criminal history, I want to make sure that the police don’t testify to that, so I’ll highlight it in pink. Similarly, if the police refer to my client’s gang membership, that should be included in a motion in limine.</p>

		<p>As I’m working my way through the discovery in this fashion, I’m also jotting down notes on a notepad. [Some lawyers make their notes on the inside of the file jacket. I prefer to leave this space available for notes concerning client interactions, such as jail visits and phone calls.] I am also folding down the corners of particularly important pages in the discovery, such as my client’s written statement, should he have been naive enough to write one.</P>


	<h2>Know the File's Status At a Glance</h2>

		<p>Finally, when I am done with this preliminary review, I write on the front of the file. Again, I do this so that I can glance at the file and instantly know its level of preparedness.</p>

		<p>If there are no marks on the front of the file at all, it’s unread.</p>

		<p>If, there is a red exclamation point, that means that there is something to be done - a pre-trial motion needs to be researched or written, a witness needs to be interviewed, the crime scene needs to be visited, whatever.</p>

		<p>A blue mark means that something, like a video or report, is missing.</p>

		<p>If the file is fully prepared, I write on the front in green. (Green means go, after all.) A √ means that the case is bad, a √+ means that it’s good, a √(+) means that it’s somewhere in between.</p>

		<p>Of course, I don’t let the prosecution in on what my markings mean. As far as they’re concerned, all of my cases are strong. Some are just stronger than others. ;)</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<p>The caseload management system outlined above may seem to be a bit regimented. A felony assistant with a lighter caseload might want to relax it a bit. Plus, since some felony files have boxes of discovery, the pile system might not be entirely practical.</p>

		<p>But, when I was a misdemeanor assistant with hundreds of files, I <em>needed </em>a regimented system, and this is the one that worked for me.</p>

		<p>Use whatever system works for you, but have a system.</p>
