    <h1>A Sample Cross (On the Reid Technique</h1>
    	
    	<!-- Needs to Be Marked Up -->

Q. Let’s talk about some of the techniques that you brought to bear in this interview. You were trying to establish a rapport, is that correct?

A. Certainly.

Q. All right. You are familiar with <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/police-interrogation2.htm" target="_blank">the Reid technique</a>?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you been trained in that technique?

A. Yes.

Q. And you brought some of the principles of the Reid technique to bear in this interview?

A. Yes.

Q. Let’s talk about the beginning of the interview. When you first meet with someone you are trying to interrogate, <a href="http://policelink.monster.com/training/articles/2745-building-rapport-during-an-interview" target="_blank">what are you supposed to do?</a>

A. I don’t know that you are supposed to anything.

Q. Well, what does the Reid technique tell you to do?

A. I am familiar with it, but I don’t necessarily follow it from A to Z.

Q. Were you trained in it?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you use some of those techniques in this interview?

A. Did I use some? Yes.

Q. All right. Did you use the technique of establishing a rapport?

A. Yes.

Q. Well, that’s what I’m asking you about. Do you understand my question?

A. I do now, yes.

Q. Let’s go to the beginning of the interview. At the beginning of the interview, did you try to establish a rapport with Mr. Doe?

A. Yes.

Q. Why?

A. Because I would like Mr. Doe to tell me what happened with regard to our investigation.

Q. But, you eventually got frustrated with Mr. Doe, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it fair to say that that was not part of the plan?

A. It’s not fair to say.

Q. Why did that happen?

A. Because, in my opinion, Mr. Doe was not being honest with what occurred in the situation he was involved with.

Q. And when you came back, why did you then take Mr. Doe’s hands in your own and ask him about his well being?

A. Because I would like to continue the interview with him.

Q. And did you think he would not continue if you continued with your aggressive stance toward him?

A. No, I did not think that.

Q. Part of the Reid technique is to create apprehension in the person that you are interrogating. Is that fair to say?

A. I don’t think I’m qualified to answer that.

Q. Did you graduate from the Reid class that you took?

A. There are many portions of the Reid technique, many levels. I have not been to all of them.

Q. I did not ask you about all of them. I am just asking you for the specific level regarding whether or not you are supposed to create apprehension in the person that you are interrogating.

A. It seems reasonable, what you are saying. I don’t have a recollection of that, though, right now.

Q. Well, you did that in this interview, didn’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. For example, you told Mr. Doe that by doing what he did, he put his mother right in front of the fucking avalanche?

A. Yes.

Q. And the reason you told him that is because you wanted him to believe that his co-defendant, Mr. Smith, was out there and might hurt Mr. Doe’s mother?

A. Correct.

Q. But, in fact, you knew that was impossible because Mr. Smith was in custody somewhere else in the police station?

A. Correct.

Q. But you didn’t tell Mr. Doe that?

A. Correct.

Q. Because you wanted to instill in him a fear that his mother might be injured if he were to refuse to talk with you?

A. No.

Q. Why tell him, then, that his mother was in danger from Mr. Smith?

A. Well, at one point, you are correct. We are trying to have the person we are interviewing believe one thing over another because there is reason to believe, in our mind that the -- not the defendant -- but the person that we are interviewing is being dishonest, not telling us the whole truth. And at times, to elicit the truth from them, we will tell them something that we know isn’t true.

Q. The purpose behind that being that you want to distress them?

A. The purpose behind it is for them to tell me the truth. If they experience distress, that’s an emotion I can’t control.

Q. But there are moments in the interview where you are actively trying to get Mr. Doe to feel distressed about the safety of his mother?

A. No. I am trying to let him understand the gravity of the situation.

Q. So, is it your testimony that the statement that he put his mother in front of the avalanche was not meant to cause him any sort of distress?

A. Yes. It wasn’t meant to cause distress.

Q. It never occurred to you that that might happen?

A. No.

Q. What about the idea of charging his mother with a crime? Why tell him that?

A. Because the possibility existed at that point in the infancy of the investigation that the mother may have had knowledge of what had happened.

Q. Wouldn’t telling him that cause him distress?

A. It may cause him distress. I don’t know what it’s going to cause him. It depends on what he knows, with regard to her involvement ...
