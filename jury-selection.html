    <h1>The Myth of Jury Selection</h1>

    <!-- Needs to be paragraphed -->


The truth is, you can’t really select a jury during <em>voir dire</em>. Why not? Because the notion of selection — meaningful selection, anyway — presupposes that you have good information. The <em>voir dire</em> process, however, generally does not produce good information because, out of fear of being laughed at or thought stupid, jurors give answers that they think will be accepted as reasonable, even if they’re not necessarily true.

[In the 1950s, a researcher named Solomon Asch conducted <a title="The Asch Experiment" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRh5qy09nNw" target="_blank">an experiment</a> meant to determine the extent to which people will conform with a group. The studies confirmed that individuals will go to great lengths not to stand out from a crowd, even if conforming requires them to act counter to what they know or believe. I have seen this many times in my practice. For example, I remember an occasion when, during polling, a juror said the word “guilty” in response to the question, “was this and is this now your verdict?” Clearly, the appropriate response is either “yes,” or “no.” “Guilty” makes no grammatical sense. Nonetheless, each one of the remaining eleven jurors gave the word “guilty” in response to the question because they did not want to distinguish themselves from the rest of the group.]

What <em>is</em> true is that most jurors come to the courthouse with fixed beliefs that are harmful to your client. Most jurors believe, for example, that your client is guilty – otherwise he wouldn’t have been charged. They also have complete faith in the trustworthiness of the prosecution. If you can’t loosen these beliefs at least a little, you have no chance of winning your trial.

Thus, instead of wasting time during <em>voir dire</em> inquiring into child care arrangements, ask questions that will awaken the doubts and concerns that a fair American juror ought to have about the trial process. Remember, these people didn’t go to law school. They haven’t considered what makes a trial fair. Their default setting is to trust the government. For a criminal defendant, that’s not a good default setting.

You must get them to change (or at least reassess) their beliefs, so that they’ll be receptive to what you say during the trial. The first step to achieving that is recognizing that you, as a defense attorney, have no credibility. (Not only do you represent thugs, you’re purely in it for the money.) The only person who is going to change the juror’s mind is the juror herself. But how do you get a juror to reexamine her beliefs such that she changes her own mind?

Enter Socrates.

Socrates got people to examine their core beliefs by using open-ended questions to encourage dialogue. He guided, but did not dominate, the conversation.

I try to approach <em>voir dire</em> as a <em>gentle</em> Socrates. I view it as an opportunity to educate, more than as an opportunity to “select.” Consider, for example, the following situation:

Q. Ms. Smith, earlier the judge asked you if you’d agree to abide by the presumption of innocence.

Juror Smith. Yes.

Q. And you said that you would abide by it?

Juror Smith: Yes.

Q. So, if you had to vote right now, not having heard any evidence, how would you vote? Guilty, or not guilty?

Juror Smith. Guilty.

[Sometimes they’ll say I don’t know, or I’d have to wait to hear all the evidence, which is slightly better than guilty, I suppose, though still completely wrong. (Mostly though, they say guilty.)]

This happens because the juror hasn’t thought about what the presumption of innocence means. They’re just answering questions with the group. Get the juror to actually think about the presumption of innocence by engaging them in a Socratic dialogue. Ask them questions like: why do you think we have a presumption of innocence, or what might be the dangers of not having such a rule?

In other words, worry about education more than selection. Trust me, you’re much more likely to get information that will help you to intelligently exercise your challenges by engaging jurors in a dialogue, rather than by delving into what exactly it is that they do for FGNH Financial.

<strong>II. Fixed Beliefs</strong>

At the outset of picking a jury, you must recognize the fixed beliefs that many jurors bring to court, and confront them, when appropriate. Let me make clear that I am not saying that all people harbor all of these beliefs. In fact, I’m sure that a few remarkable people harbor none of them. However, I suspect that most prospective jurors bring at least one of these beliefs with them to court. Although it will not always make sense to address them directly during <em>voir dire</em>, in some cases, it might make sense. Either way, you do good service to your client if you at least keep these in mind during jury selection, and stay on alert for prospective jurors who you suspect will be unable to overcome them. I make this last point because, while I call these “fixed” beliefs, I do not mean to suggest that they are necessarily<em>permanently</em> fixed. By using the Socratic Method, you may be able to loosen some of these beliefs, and turn a previously unsympathetic juror into a receptive one.

Now for the beliefs. In your venire, you can assume that there are people who:

1. Are afraid of black people and, in particular, think that all young black men are violent.

2. Think that all Hispanic people are illegal.

3. Think that all illegal people are dishonest.

4. Think that all defense attorneys are dishonest.

5. Think that your client wouldn’t have been charged if he wasn’t guilty.

6. Think that your client would take the stand if he wasn’t guilty.

7. Worship the police.

8. Think that, if the prosecution wants it, it must be justice.

The first three of these are touchy and, as I said, you may not want to address them directly. However, you can bring them up in a relatively non-accusatory way by asking a question such as, Mr. Smith, what effect, if any, should James’ race have on your verdict? Of course, Mr. Smith will say none, but this at least alerts him and the other jurors that you are aware that this may be an issue in the case. Thus, the jurors may monitor each other during deliberations to make sure that the poison of racism does not taint their discussion. Perhaps I’m being naive, but I don’t think so.

You can’t do much about number four. Just don’t do anything to confirm that misconception.

Numbers five through eight can each be touched upon by discussing the <em>Zehr</em>Principles, and, unlike the other four, they <em>should</em> be touched upon. If you go into opening statement with any of your jurors still holding firm to these beliefs, you have very little chance of winning.

<strong>III. The <em>Zehr</em> Principles</strong>

In Illinois, trial courts are supposed to establish that prospective jurors accept the following principles: 1) that the defendant is presumed innocent, 2) that the prosecution bears the burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and 3) that, should the defendant choose not to testify, that decision cannot be held against him. [These are known as the “<em>Zehr</em> Principles,” after <em>People v. Zehr</em>, 469 N.E.2d 1062 (1984).]

Although the court asks these questions of the <em>venire</em>, when individual jurors are called to be seated in the jury box, you should revisit these principles with them by engaging them in a dialogue. This is because, when asked as a group, no one will raise their hands to express disagreement, since <a title="Candid Camera: Conformity" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuvGh_n3I_M" target="_blank">they don’t want to stand out</a>. As a result, many people will say that they agree with them without having given them serious, or any, thought. Talking about the <em>Zehr</em> principles is an excellent way to get prospective jurors to become aware of, and, hopefully, reassess, fixed beliefs that they probably don’t even realize that they hold.

How much time should you spend discussing these principles? I would say that about 80% of my <em>voir dire </em>consists of questions related to <em>Zehr</em>. [Also, note that I do not discuss the Principle concerning the defendant's right not to testify if I know that my client is going to testify.] The remaining 20% is spent discussing the one big issue that is at the center of my case.

<strong>IV. The One Big Issue</strong>

If, in addition to the <em>Zehr</em> Principles, there is one other issue that looms large in my case, I <em>voir dire</em> on that as well.

For example, if it’s a DUI trial, I’ll ask jurors their opinions regarding alcohol. If it’s a self defense case, I’ll <em>voir dire</em> on whether they think physical violence is ever justified. If it’s an insanity defense, I’ll ask them if they know anyone with a mental illness.

Question about those issues, but be mindful that the jurors are in an uncomfortable position already. Don’t embarrass them or give them a reason to resent you by pressing too hard or belaboring the point. If a juror says that her father was an alcoholic, for example, don’t ask for details. Just establish whether she agrees that it would be wrong to punish your client for whatever her father may have done in the past.

Also, try not to ask about more than your one main issue – whatever it is. If you think you have more than one main issue, look again. Pick the most important one.

The reason for this is that you don’t want to wear out your welcome in voir dire. The jurors know that they still have a whole trial to go. They’re concerned about getting back to their jobs and their families. If they believe that you’re prolonging their service (if, in other words, your voir dire is too long), you’ll turn them off to you, and they won’t listen to you when the trial actually starts.

<strong>V. A Sample <em>Voir Dire</em></strong>

Below, you’ll find an example of how I use the <em>Zehr</em> Principles to get the jurors to think about what it means to have a fair trial. Note that much of what takes place is a dialogue, not only between the lawyer and the juror, but also between the jurors themselves. If one juror says something that I think will help the conversation, I’ll ask another juror whether they agree with it. Also, I rarely lead. There’s no point. The juror will simply agree with me. Instead, I ask open-ended questions that are designed to guide the jurors to the conclusions that I’m hoping they will draw. [I <em>do</em> lead if the juror is particularly dull, and simply cannot grasp the point that I am trying to make.]

Finally, as I’m sure you remember from law school, the Socratic Method can be a little uncomfortable. That’s why I stress that you must be a <em>gentle</em> Socrates. Many of these people have never thought about these ideas before, and they may be (and probably should be) ashamed of that. The purpose is not to embarrass them, it’s to get them to consider the possibility that the police and the government might be wrong. The Socratic Method is the best tool for getting that to happen, but recognize that it’s also a very powerful tool. Overuse it and you’ll poison that juror against you. Educate, don’t alienate.

Here we go:

Q: Mr. Smith, I’m going to start with you. Good morning.

Juror Smith: Good morning.

Q. Judge Teasdale asked you if you agreed with the principle that James is presumed innocent. Do you remember that?

Juror Smith: Yes.

Q. And you said that you did?

Juror Smith: Yes.

Q. Tell me. Do you think that’s a good idea, that people who are in James’ position are presumed innocent?

Juror Smith: Yes.

Q. Why?

Juror Smith: Well. That’s just the way our system does it.
<em>[This is a non-answer, suggesting that Juror Smith doesn’t really understand the principles.]</em>

Q. Yes, but why? Well, let me put it this way: do you think it would be a better system if we presumed people guilty?

Juror Smith: No.

Q. What do you think might happen if we had that kind of system?

Juror Smith: Well, I think that’s not our system. People should be presumed innocent.
<em>[Another non-answer. Smith is a dud. I may have to use a peremptory on him. Let’s see if I can find a juror who might actually be able to articulate why we have a presumption of innocence. Namely, it’s a safeguard against the conviction of the innocent.]</em>

Q. All right. Ms. Baker, what do you think? Do you agree with Mr. Smith that we have a good system?

Juror Baker: Yes, I do.

Q. Why?

Juror Baker: Well, I think if they’re going to say that somebody did something, they should have to prove it, that’s all.
<em>[Finally!]</em>

Q. Let me ask you: what do you think might happen if we had a system where people were presumed to be guilty? Is there a risk associated with that?

Juror Baker: Sure, I think that some people who didn’t do anything might be found guilty.

Q. Is that acceptable? To find someone guilty if they didn’t do anything?

Juror Baker: No. Of course not.
<em>[Go Ms. Baker! Now let’s try to get some of these other to agree with her.]</em>

Q. Ms. Rankin? Is that acceptable?

Juror Rankin: No.
<em>[I like this idea of not wanting innocent people to be convicted. I want all the jurors to worry about that, so I’m going to pass this question around a bit. Also, note that, by getting other people to agree with Ms. Baker’s helpful answer, you are using people’s propensity to conform (the Asch study) to your advantage.]</em>

Q. Mr. Weiss?

Juror Weiss: No. Absolutely not.
<em>[Okay, now let’s transition to another principle: the burden of proof.]</em>

Q. Mr. Weiss, do you think it should be easy for someone to be convicted of a crime?

Juror Weiss: How do you mean?

Q. Well, do you think this a serious case?

Juror Weiss: Yes. Of course.

Q. If you’re selected to be on this jury, do you promise to take your job seriously?

Juror Weiss: Certainly.

Q. Well, do you recognize then that, while you’re not to consider sentencing or punishment or anything like that, being convicted of a crime is a big deal?

Juror Weiss: Yes.

Q. Judge Teasdale told you that the burden of proof in this case is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Do you remember that?

Juror Weiss: Yes.

Q. That’s the highest burden known to law. Did you know that?
<em>[Illinois doesn’t let us define reasonable doubt, but this seems okay.]</em>

Juror Weiss: No.

Q. Mr. Simmons, I think you said you had served on a jury before?

Juror Simmons: That’s correct.

Q. That was a civil jury?

Juror Simmons: I believe so. Yes.

Q. You understand that the burden of proof in that case was a preponderance of the evidence – a lower burden than what exists in this case?

Juror Simmons: Yes. I think so.

Q. In other words, it was easier for the plaintiff to prove that case, than it will be for the prosecution to prove this one.
<em>[This might draw an objection.]</em>

Prosecution. Objection, judge.

The Court. Sustained.
<em>[No problem. Let’s try it another way.]</em>

Q. Well, let me ask you this: do you think it should be easy for the prosecution to prove someone guilty?

Prosecution. Objection.

The Court. Overruled.
<em>[Cool.]</em>

Juror Simmons: No.

Q. Why not?

Juror Simmons: Well, I think it’s important that, before we convict someone, we’re certain that he committed the crime.

Q. And, if you’re selected as a juror in this case, do you promise to hold the state to that burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt throughout their case?

Juror Simmons: Yes. I do.
<em>[We don’t want to wear out our welcome. Let’s just go around the room again to make sure that they know that I want them to take this seriously.]</em>

Q. Mr. Weiss. Will you?

Juror Weiss: Yes.

Q. Ms. Baker?

Juror Baker: Yes.

Note: If I knew that my client was going to testify I would stop here. I wouldn’t even mention this principle. If I knew that he wasn’t however, or if I wasn’t sure, I would address it.

Q. I also want to take a moment to talk to you about something else Judge Teasdale mentioned. She said that, should I advise James not to testify, you can’t hold that against him. Mr. Schumacher, I haven’t spoken with you yet. What do you think about that?

Juror Schumacher: Honestly?

Q. Yes. Of course.

Juror Schumacher: I would hold it against him.
<em>[This is not a problem. Sometimes a bad juror is a blessing. Based on this answer, you already know that you’re going to excuse him, but don’t do so just yet. Instead, use him as a foil for the other jurors.]</em>

Q. Okay. Why?

Juror Schumacher: Well, I just think that if someone was really innocent, they would get up here and say so, is all.

Q. Okay. Well, you’re right. One reason a person may not choose to testify is because they’re guilty. You’re right about that. But, can you think of some other, innocent, reason why they might choose not to do that?

Juror Schumacher: No. I really can’t. I’m just being honest with you.
<em>[Okay, that’s enough bad stuff. Now I need someone to disagree. How about trusty Ms. Baker?]</em>

Q. And I appreciate that honesty. I really do. Ms. Baker, can you think of a reason?

Juror Baker: Well, they might be afraid, I suppose.
<em>[Yes!]</em>

Q. Yeah. I mean, do you think it’s easy to testify? To get up here and take the stand?

Juror Baker: No. I’m sure that it isn’t.
<em>[Let’s try to spread Ms. Baker’s good answer around, again relying on Solomon Asch.]</em>

Q. Mr. Weiss, do you?

Juror Weiss: No.

Q. If James decides not to take the stand, the law prevents me from telling you why – whether it’s because he has a stutter, or whether it’s because he’s guilty. Do you understand that?

Juror Weiss: Yes.

Q. And, knowing that, do you think you can still listen to this case and give him a fair trial?

Juror Weiss: Yes. I think so.

Q. Mr. Schumacher?

Juror Schumacher: I’ll try, but it’s going to be a problem for me. I’m just being honest.

Q. I appreciate that. I do.
<em>[And you do. You want jurors to be truthful so that the bad ones will reveal themselves. Thus, never punish them for giving an answer that repulses you.]</em>

Q. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk to you about one further thing …
